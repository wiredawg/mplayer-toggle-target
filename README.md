# Mplayer Sound Card Selection

I just did a symlink of `!/.mplayer` to the `_mplayer` directory. In that
directory is a simple bash script to switch which config file is the one
that mplayer reads. My config files are basic but if there was more duplication
between them than a different mechanism would be better. This works for me 
right now.
